# Folded-Cascode-Amplifier
<h1>Design of Folded Cascode Amplifier for Analog ASICs</h1>
Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and optimization of a folded cascode amplifier at the transistor level, specifically tailored for ASICs. The primary goals were to achieve a bandwidth of 100 MHz and a gain exceeding 70 dB. This design has been meticulously optimized using Tanner EDA simulations.

Key Features
Bandwidth: 100 MHz
Gain: >70 dB
Supply Voltage (Vdd): 1.8V
Optimization Tool: Tanner EDA
Design Highlights
One of the most notable features of this design is the use of a low voltage swing Cascode current mirror. Given the Vdd of 1.8V, the design successfully achieves a high voltage swing at the output, which is critical for maintaining performance and efficiency in analog ASIC applications.
